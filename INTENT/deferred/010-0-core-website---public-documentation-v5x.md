## Why

GitHub is for code. A website shares the philosophy publicly.
Attract like-minded Linux users.

## What

- GitHub Pages (free, simple)
- PHILOSOPHY.md as landing page
- Tool documentation
- Getting started guide
- Community profiles showcase

## Dependencies

- When ready to share publicly
- After Rust rewrite (v5.x)

_Part of the 0-Core Intent Ledger_ 🌲

## Decision: Cancelled (2026-01-14)

**Reason:**
GitHub repository already serves as public documentation:
- README.md - Overview, quick reference, tool inventory
- docs/THEORY_OF_OPERATION.md - Full philosophy
- INTENT/ - Complete decision history
- CHANGELOG.md - Evolution and releases

A separate website would:
- Duplicate existing documentation
- Add maintenance burden without value
- Conflict with "explicitness over presentation" principle
- Introduce another surface to keep synchronized

**The raw documentation is more honest.**

GitHub is not just "for code"—it's where the actual work lives. The philosophy is in the commits, the structure, the Intent Ledger. A polished site would be performative, not authentic.

The people who understand 0-Core will find it on GitHub.
The people who need a marketing site won't understand 0-Core anyway.

This is cancelled with clarity, not regret.
