# faelight-fm - Semantic Filesystem Interface

**Status:** Awaiting Linus feedback before implementation

## Vision

A file manager that understands MEANING, not just files:
- Intent integration (why files exist)
- Zone awareness (spatial safety)
- Health monitoring (system state)
- Recovery-first operations (snapshots)

## Why This Matters

Yazi shows "what's here". Faelight FM answers:
- Why does this exist?
- Is it safe to touch?
- What breaks if I delete it?
- Can I recover?

## Core Architecture

## Linus Mentioned This

Email 2026-01-26: He's interested in the concept.
**CRITICAL:** Get his architectural input BEFORE building.

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 0:** Present idea to Linus (Friday)
**Phase 1:** Incorporate feedback into design
**Phase 2:** Build with guidance, not in isolation

## Why Not Now

Intent 067 principle: "Wait for Linus + Rest"
- Better code with his input
- Avoid scope creep before presentation
- Show discipline, not just velocity
