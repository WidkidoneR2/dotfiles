## Vision

Unified architecture for all Faelight tools with shared foundation.

**Goal:** Eliminate duplication, 70%+ performance gain, enable future tools

## Breaking Changes Allowed

v7.0.0 permits breaking changes to achieve architectural goals.

## Timeline

**3-4 weeks total:**
- Week 1: Build faelight-core (Intent 047)
- Week 2: Refactor existing tools (Intent 048)  
- Week 3-4: Launcher v2.0 (Intent 049)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] faelight-core library shipped
- [ ] All tools 70%+ faster (glyph cache)
- [ ] Zero code duplication in rendering
- [ ] Launcher has provider architecture
- [ ] Safety layer complete (menu + launcher + intent-guard)
- [ ] 100% health maintained

## Philosophy Validation

**Does this advance 0-Core principles?**

✅ **Manual Control:** Provider architecture enables choice  
✅ **Understanding:** Explainable ranking teaches  
✅ **Safety:** Confirmation + risk integration  
✅ **Performance:** Glyph cache = respect for resources
