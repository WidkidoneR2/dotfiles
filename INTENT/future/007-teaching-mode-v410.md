## Why

0-Core philosophy is "simple but easy to learn." New users need guidance.
Current state: Read docs and figure it out.
Goal: Interactive walkthrough that teaches the system.

## What

`0-core teach` command — interactive CLI guide:

- Tour of directory structure (0-core, 1-src, etc.)
- Explain each tool (dot-doctor, core-diff, intent, etc.)
- Demonstrate key workflows
- Philosophy embedded in teaching

## Success Criteria

- New user can understand 0-Core in 30 minutes
- No prior knowledge required
- Teaching feels natural, not forced
