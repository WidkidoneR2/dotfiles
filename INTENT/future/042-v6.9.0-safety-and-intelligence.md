## The Vision

Polish v6.x to maturity before v7.0.0 architectural refactor.

**Theme:** Make existing tools smarter and safer without automation.

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

---

## Core Feature: intent-guard (Intent 013)

**Policy enforcement without automation.**

### What It Does

Watches for risky patterns BEFORE execution:
- Destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `dd`, etc)
- System modifications (`pacman -Rns`, etc)
- Network exposure (`chmod 777`, world-readable files)
- Privilege escalation patterns

### How It Works
```bash
$ rm -rf ~/important-stuff
⚠️  intent-guard: Destructive command detected
   Pattern: rm -rf on home directory
   Risk: HIGH
   Last used: Never
   
   Continue? [y/N]
```

**Philosophy:** Never blocks, only warns. You always have final say.

### Implementation

- Shell integration (preexec hook)
- Pattern matching engine
- Learning from confirmations
- Configurable risk levels

---

## Supporting Features

### 1. entropy-check Enhancements

**Current:** Basic drift detection  
**v6.9.0:**
- Configurable baselines (per-profile)
- Drift trends over time (`entropy-check trends`)
- Integration with dot-doctor
- Alerts on critical drift

### 2. Launcher Intelligence (Intent 038)

**Frecency Tracking:**
- Track app launch frequency
- Boost recent + frequent apps
- Smart sorting based on usage

**Implementation:**
- Store in `~/.local/state/faelight/launcher-history.json`
- Decay algorithm for recency

### 3. Tool Documentation

**Complete man pages:**
- `man faelight-launcher`
- `man entropy-check`
- `man intent`
- etc.

**Implementation:**
- Write proper `.1` man pages
- Install to `~/.local/share/man/man1/`

---

## Out of Scope (Defer to v7.0.0)

- ❌ teach-advanced (too large, separate from safety theme)
- ❌ faelight-core refactor (architectural, belongs in v7.0)
- ❌ Notification intelligence (feature creep)

---

## Success Criteria

**Must Have:**
- [x] intent-guard v0.1 working
- [ ] Shell integration tested
- [ ] Pattern database established
- [ ] entropy-check trends
- [ ] launcher frecency

**Nice to Have:**
- [ ] Man pages for 5+ tools
- [ ] dot-doctor drift integration

**Quality Bar:**
- [ ] 100% health maintained
- [ ] Zero regressions
- [ ] All new features documented

---

## Estimated Effort

- intent-guard: 3-4 days (core feature)
- entropy enhancements: 1 day
- launcher intelligence: 1 day
- Documentation: 1 day
- Testing & polish: 1 day

**Total:** ~7-9 days of focused work

## Additional Safety Features (Added 2026-01-13)

### 4. Keybind Conflict Detection (Intent 044) ✅

**Tool: keyscan**
- Parse Sway config
- Detect duplicate keybinds
- Report conflicts before applying
- Integration with dot-doctor

### 5. Package Manager Validation

**Verify paru setup:**
- Ensure yay fully removed
- Validate topgrade config
- Test PKGBUILD review workflow
- Document in dot-doctor
