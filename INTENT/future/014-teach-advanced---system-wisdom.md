## The Vision

Evolution of `teach`. Turns 0-Core into a living textbook.

## Why

`teach` covers the basics. But wisdom is deeper:

- Why is the system built this way?
- How do you recover from disaster?
- How do you migrate to new hardware?
- How do you debug Wayland at 2am?

## Topics

### Philosophy

- `teach-advanced philosophy` — The theory of operation
- `teach-advanced decisions` — Why each intent was decided

### Recovery

- `teach-advanced recovery disk` — Full disk failure
- `teach-advanced recovery boot` — Unbootable system
- `teach-advanced recovery config` — Broken configuration

### Migration

- `teach-advanced migrate hardware` — New machine setup
- `teach-advanced migrate distro` — Moving to different base

### Debugging

- `teach-advanced debug wayland` — Compositor issues
- `teach-advanced debug network` — Connectivity problems
- `teach-advanced debug audio` — PipeWire troubleshooting

## Implementation

- Interactive walkthroughs
- Pulls from actual system state
- Links to relevant intents
- Verifies understanding with checks

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive recovery guides
- [ ] Migration documentation
- [ ] Debug walkthroughs
- [ ] Integrated with intent system
- [ ] Actually teaches (not just documents)
