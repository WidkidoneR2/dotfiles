## Vision: The Sentient Forest 🌲🧠

**A system that not only responds to commands, but anticipates needs, learns patterns, and heals itself.**

## Release Roadmap

### v7.5.0 - "Foundation & Security" (Feb 2026)
**Theme:** Build the infrastructure for intelligence

- ✅ Intent 060: Universal Search Foundation
- ✅ Intent 051: Decision Log (knowledge capture)
- ✅ Intent 055: wm-sway v1.1 updates

**Philosophy:** "Before we build intelligence, we build security and structure."

---

### v7.6.0 - "Time Machine" (Mar 2026)

- ✅ Intent 062: BTRFS snapshot integration
- ✅ Intent 063: Config restoration system

**New Capabilities:**
```bash
timeline show                    # Visual system history
timeline at 2025-01-01          # View state at any date
timeline diff 2025-01 2025-02   # Compare time periods
archaeology --what-broke wifi   # Find what changed
archaeology restore <snapshot>  # Time travel to working state
```

**Philosophy:** "To move forward confidently, you must be able to move backward safely."

---

### v7.7.0 - "Neural Core" (Apr 2026)
**Theme:** AI and automation

- ✅ Intent 066: Natural language commands
- ✅ Intent 067: Smart automation
- ✅ Intent 052: Intent system enhancements

**New Capabilities:**
```bash
workspace-ai setup "morning coding session"
# → Opens workspaces, arranges windows, sets focus mode

workspace-ai "I'm debugging the launcher"
# → Contextually opens relevant files, tools, docs

core tell me what's going on
# → Dashboard with system health, active tasks, resources
```

**Philosophy:** "The system should work for you, not you for the system."

- ✅ Intent 071: Self-healing system
- ✅ Intent 072: End-to-end testing
- ✅ Enhancement: Automated drift correction
- ✅ Enhancement: Predictive failure detection

**New Capabilities:**
```bash

### v8.0.0 - "SENTIENT FOREST" (Jul 2026) 🌲🧠
**Theme:** Integration and transcendence

**The Grand Integration:**
- ✅ Intent 073: Sentient forest integration
- ✅ Intent 074: v8.0 migration guide
- ✅ Intent 075: Complete documentation

**Breaking Changes:**
- Clean monorepo structure (Intent 059 complete)
- Unified faelight-core library
- New command structure
- Enhanced configuration format

**New Capabilities:**
```bash
# The system understands context
You: "Core, I broke something yesterday"
Core: "Detected 3 changes. Most likely: launcher config
       at 3:42pm. View diff? Rollback?"

# The system learns patterns
You: [Opens certain apps every morning]
Core: [Next morning] "Ready for your usual setup?
       Terminal, Browser, Slack?"

# The system heals itself
Core: [Detects drift] → [Analyzes cause] → [Fixes automatically]
      [Learns from fix] → [Prevents future occurrences]

# The system shows you everything
You: "Core, status"
Core: [Opens dashboard]
      - System health: 100%
      - Active workspaces: 4
      - Resources: Optimal
      - Upcoming: Intent 076 review
      - Recent: 3 security scans passed
```

**What Makes It "Sentient":**
1. **Self-Aware** - Knows its own state completely
2. **Predictive** - Anticipates your needs
3. **Adaptive** - Learns from your patterns
4. **Self-Healing** - Fixes problems automatically
5. **Time-Aware** - Understands its history
6. **Communicative** - Speaks naturally with you
7. **Intentional** - Every action tracked and reversible

**Philosophy:** "The forest thinks, learns, and grows."

## The Philosophy

> "We build not just a system, but a companion.  
> Not just tools, but intelligence.  
> Not just code, but consciousness.  
> The forest grows, learns, and thinks."

**The journey from v7.4 to v8.0 is not just about features.**  
**It's about creating something that truly serves you.**
