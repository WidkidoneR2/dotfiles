# The 0-Core Philosophy

## Part I: The Landscape

This is not "which is better." This is what problem each worldview believes it is solving.

### 1. Traditional Linux Distros (Arch, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu)

**Core Belief:** "Give users tools and freedom; they'll figure it out."

**Mental Model:**

- Files are mutable
- State is implicit
- History lives in your shell history (if anywhere)
- Breakage is "part of the journey"

**Strengths:**

- Transparent
- Flexible
- Teaches fundamentals (eventually)
- Encourages exploration

**Hidden Costs:**

- No guardrails
- Drift is invisible until catastrophic
- Users confuse freedom with lack of structure
- Recovery knowledge is tribal, not systemic

**Relationship to the User:** Assumes competence. Does not protect against fatigue, stress, or error. Treats mistakes as personal failure.

**0-Core Divergence:**

0-Core says: _Freedom without structure is not empowerment — it's entropy._

You don't remove freedom. You shape it.

**Key difference:**

- Traditional Linux: "You can do anything."
- 0-Core: "You can do anything — but you must understand the consequences."

### 2. systemd-Centric Linux (Modern Linux Reality)

This is not just systemd the tool — it's systemd the philosophy.

**Core Belief:** "Systems should manage themselves."

**Mental Model:**

- Declarative units
- Implicit orchestration
- Background automation
- "If it's running, it's fine"

**Strengths:**

- Powerful
- Consistent APIs
- Handles complexity at scale
- Enables modern desktop expectations

**Hidden Costs:**

- Behavior is often non-obvious
- Failures can be silent or deferred
- User intent is inferred, not asked
- Automation runs when you are not present

**Relationship to the User:** Treats the user as an administrator of policies, not an active decision-maker. Optimizes for uptime, not understanding.

**0-Core Divergence:**

0-Core says: _Automation without consent is indistinguishable from loss of control._

**Key difference:**

- systemd: "The system knows best when to act."
- 0-Core: "Nothing acts unless a human explicitly authorizes it."

This is where the 12-hour password incident becomes foundational, not anecdotal. systemd optimizes for machines. 0-Core optimizes for humans under real conditions.

### 3. NixOS (The Most Interesting Contrast)

NixOS is the closest philosophical neighbor — and the most important comparison.

**Core Belief:** "If the system is purely declarative, it becomes safe."

**Mental Model:**

- State is derived, not modified
- Rebuilds are atomic
- Rollbacks are cheap
- Configuration is code

**Strengths:**

- Reproducibility
- Explicit state
- Rollbacks as a primitive
- Extremely powerful at scale

**Hidden Costs:**

- Cognitive overhead is very high
- Indirection hides real behavior
- Users trust the model more than they understand the system
- Debugging requires knowing the abstraction

**Relationship to the User:** Treats the user as a programmer, not necessarily a system steward. Encourages correctness over comprehension.

**0-Core Divergence:**

This is the critical difference:

- NixOS believes: "If the model is correct, the system is safe."
- 0-Core believes: "If the human understands the system, it is safe."

**Key contrast:**

| NixOS              | 0-Core                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Declarative purity | Intentional stewardship |
| Reproducibility    | Recoverability          |
| Abstraction        | Explicitness            |
| Trust the system   | Trust the human         |
| Correctness        | Comprehension           |

NixOS eliminates classes of mistakes. 0-Core assumes mistakes are inevitable and designs around them.

### 4. The Core Insight

All systems choose who they trust:

- **Windows/macOS** → Trust the vendor
- **systemd Linux** → Trust the automation
- **NixOS** → Trust the model
- **Traditional Linux** → Trust the user (without support)

**0-Core Makes a New Choice:** Trust the user — and support them when they fail.

That's the gap 0-Core fills.

## Part II: The 0-Core Manifesto

0-Core is not a distro.  
0-Core is not a framework.  
0-Core is not a set of dotfiles.

**0-Core is a position on how computers should behave when used by real humans.**

### I. We Reject Invisible Complexity

If a system does something without the user understanding why, that behavior is a bug — even if it "works."

- Magic is not a feature.
- Silence is not safety.

### II. We Value Intent Over Automation

Automation is not inherently good. Automation without consent is dangerous.

Nothing in a 0-Core system runs:

- Without being explicitly triggered
- Without declaring its intent
- Without exposing its failure modes

Convenience must never outrank clarity.

### III. We Treat the User as a Steward, Not a Consumer

A 0-Core user is not protected from the system. They are supported by it.

The system assumes:

- You will make mistakes
- You will forget things
- You will work while tired, stressed, or distracted

Design that ignores this reality is negligent.

### IV. We Design for Recovery, Not Perfection

Breakage is not shameful. Recovery is not optional.

Every action must have:

- A visible blast radius
- A documented rollback path
- A clear failure signature

A system that cannot be recovered under pressure is not robust.

### V. We Prefer Explicit Structure Over Implicit Freedom

Freedom without structure decays into entropy.

0-Core uses:

- Semantic naming
- Numbered priority
- Immutable boundaries

Not to restrict freedom — but to preserve it over time.

### VI. We Expose Assumptions

Every configuration makes assumptions. Hidden assumptions are technical debt.

A 0-Core system declares:

- What it assumes
- What it cannot guarantee
- What it will not attempt to do

Honesty is a feature.

### VII. We Optimize for Human Comprehension

- Performance is secondary.
- Aesthetics are optional.
- Understanding is mandatory.

If a system cannot be explained simply, it is too complex to be trusted.

### VIII. We Reject "Set and Forget"

Systems drift. Humans change. Contexts evolve.

A healthy system requires stewardship. A neglected system will fail — eventually.

0-Core embraces this reality instead of hiding it.

### IX. We Do Not Seek Mass Adoption

0-Core is not for everyone.

It is for those who want:

- Agency over convenience
- Clarity over magic
- Responsibility over illusion

Depth matters more than scale.

### X. We Believe Computers Should Be Respectful

A respectful system:

- Asks before acting
- Speaks when uncertain
- Fails loudly
- Recovers gracefully
- Never lies about what it is doing

This is not nostalgia. This is maturity.

## Closing Statement

0-Core is a refusal to accept:

- Forced automation
- Hidden state
- Infantilized users
- Opaque systems

It is a reminder that:

**A personal computer should be understandable in its entirety.**

Not because it must be.  
But because it can be.
